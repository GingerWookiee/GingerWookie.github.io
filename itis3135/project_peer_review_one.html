                File Management
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All folders are properly named</li>
                <li>All files are in the appropriate place in the folders</li>
                <li>Filenames could use some work, as they are in cammel case, when there should be no capitals, and underscodes for spaces between words</li>
                <li>The index/home page needs to be fixed, as it has a filename other than index.html</li>
            </ul> 
            <h3>
                Styles
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>For pages that have styling, the styling is consistant, and contrast/styling is good</li>
                <li>Some pages still need styling</li>
                <li>Your footers are not style on any pages</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Page Design
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Your footer is a bit too large, with repitition of the header</li>
                <li>I would increase the margins a bit, as the words and stuff are very close to the edges of the pages</li>
                <li>contrast and color palette are good</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Validation
            </h3>

            </ul>
            <h3>
                Page Code
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Code is clean and organized</li>
                <li>Might be using divs a bit much. You might want to try using other tags a bit, such as sections.</li>
