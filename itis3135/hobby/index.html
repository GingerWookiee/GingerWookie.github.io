                    The hobby that I chose to build a site about is a bit 
                    unconvetional, but what I chose is collecting mil-surp. 
                    Mil-surp stands for miliray surplus, and can be catagorized
                    in a few ways. The 2 big catagories are firearms, and 
                    equipment. The latter is about items such as clothing, worn gear
                    like vests and backpacks, rations, and packed gear such as 
                    bunking material and safety equipment. The Prior is about 
                    firearms that at one point were used in military service, but
                    were phased out with better technology. Many are
                    sold or given to smaller or developing contries until they could
                    gather or build their own arms supply for their troops. After
                    that, they are sold to be inported into the US commercial market
                    to be sold commercially. Mil-surp is done both as a way to 
                    preserve historical items, as well as for governments to get 
                    more worth the phasing out of equipment than gained through 
                    the scrapping, trashing, or distruction of equipment. I am a
                    part of the first group, having a collection of historical
                    military firearms.

                    Hello, my name is Daniel, and I am 19 years old. I am in 
                    the College of Computing and Informatics at the University
                    of North Carrolina At Charlotte, and am in my second year 
                    there. I have mayn hobbies including hiking, gaming, playing
                    with my dog, and of course(seeing as you are on the site for
                    this hobby), collecting mil-surp and historical firearms.
                </p>

            <section id="where">
                <h2>Where I Look</h2>
                <p>
                    In the local Charlotte area, there aren't many gun stores,
                    and the stores there are typically either are pawn and gun
                    stores, or are smaller stores with an indoor range. Because of
                    this, there aren't really any stores that I have found with
                    mil-surp in stock, so I go to online sources. I use a mixture
                    of auction sites, as well as online stores to see what is 
                    available, and the worth and condition of items. I also use
                    online recources to do research on any firearms that I plan to buy
                    before purchasing. After purchase, firearms are shipped based laws
                    and firearm classification, but for virtually all purchases*
                    (except those exempted as antique through the US gun control act)
                    are shipped to an FFL, or Federal Firearms Lisense, where you 
                    undergo a background check by the lisensed entity, and if you 
                    pass it, the firearm is transfered into your name. I typically will
                    buy from online stores where I am getting "new" surplus, or surplus
                    that is being sold on the commercial market for the first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    here are links to a few of the sites that I have used, for anyone
                    interested. I know that there are others, but I am still somewhat
                    new to collecting, and don't use many right now. Also, I know some
                    people favor some sites over others, so I will say that only know 
                    of these sites as a customer.
