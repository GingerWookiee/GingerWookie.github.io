                    The hobby that I chose to build a site about is a bit 
                    unconvetional, but what I chose is collecting mil-surp. 
                    Mil-surp stands for miliray surplus, and can be catagorized
                    in a few ways. The 2 big catagories are firearms, and 
                    equipment. The latter is about items such as clothing, worn gear
                    like vests and backpacks, rations, and packed gear such as 
                    bunking material and safety equipment. The Prior is about 
                    firearms that at one point were used in military service, but
                    were phased out with better technology. Many are
                    sold or given to smaller or developing contries until they could
                    gather or build their own arms supply for their troops. After
                    that, they are sold to be inported into the US commercial market
                    to be sold commercially. Mil-surp is done both as a way to 
                    preserve historical items, as well as for governments to get 
                    more worth the phasing out of equipment than gained through 
                    the scrapping, trashing, or distruction of equipment. I am a
                    part of the first group, having a collection of historical
                    military firearms.
