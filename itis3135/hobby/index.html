                    The hobby that I chose to build a site about is a bit unconventional, 
                    but what I chose is collecting mil-surp. Mil-surp stands for military 
                    surplus, and can be categorized in a few ways. The 2 big categories 
                    are firearms, and equipment. The latter is about items such as 
                    clothing, worn gear like vests and backpacks, rations, and packed gear 
                    such as bunking material and safety equipment. The Prior is about 
                    firearms that at one point were used in military service, but were 
                    phased out with better technology. Many are sold or given to smaller 
                    or developing countries until they could gather or build their own arms 
                    supply for their troops. After that, they are sold to be imported into 
                    the US commercial market to be sold commercially. Mil-surp is done both 
                    as a way to preserve historical items, as well as for governments to get 
                    more worth the phasing out of equipment than gained through the 
                    scrapping, trashing, or destruction of equipment. I am a part of the 
                    first group, having a collection of historical military firearms.

                    Hello, my name is Daniel, and I am 19 years old. I am in 
                    the College of Computing and Informatics at the University 
                    of North Carolina At Charlotte, and am in my second year 
                    there. I have many hobbies including hiking, gaming, playing 
                    with my dog, and of course(seeing as you are on the site for 
                    this hobby), collecting mil-surp and historical firearms. 
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="where">
                <h2>Where I Look</h2>
                <p>
                    In the local Charlotte area, there aren't many gun stores, and the 
                    stores there are typically either pawn and gun stores, or are 
                    smaller stores with an indoor range. Because of this, there aren't 
                    really any stores that I have found with mil-surp in stock, so 
                    I go to online sources. I use a mixture of auction sites, as well 
                    as online stores to see what is available, and the worth and 
                    condition of items. I also use online resources to do research on 
                    any firearms that I plan to buy before purchasing. After purchase, 
                    firearms are shipped based laws and firearm classification, but for 
                    virtually all purchases* (except those exempted as antique through 
                    the US gun control act) are shipped to an FFL, or Federal Firearms 
                    License, where you undergo a background check by the licensed entity, 
                    and if you pass it, the firearm is transferred into your name. I 
                    typically will buy from online stores where I am getting "new" 
                    surplus, or surplus that is being sold on the commercial market for 
                    the first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are links to a few of the sites that I have used, for anyone 
                    interested. I know that there are others, but I am still somewhat 
                    new to collecting, and don't use many right now. Also, I know some 
                    people favor some sites over others, so I will say that I only know  
                    of these sites as a customer.

                <p>
                    With military surplus, there is a lot of uncertainty with timing. 
                    By this, I mean that it cannot be known ahead of time what surplus 
                    is coming in, and when things will be in stock. Other times, there 
                    are many surplus rifles all coming at once. Of course every 
                    collector, including myself, has a list of firearms they want, but 
                    you can't easily collect exactly what you want whenever you want. 
                    The waiting time is spent enjoying what you already have, as well 
                    as learning about the guns you have and are looking for. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>
                    Say you're looking for a German Mauser, such as a k98, it will be 
                    hard to find, and probably very expensive. If you want to, you can 
                    wait, but if you don't mind doing some research, and a bit of 
                    compromising, you can find many k98s that were captured such as 
                    the Yugo k98, or even rifles made using captured machinery post war 
                    such as the Yugo M98. If you're not looking strictly, then you 
                    could branch out to other country‚Äôs Mausers such as the Spanish 
                    M43. Other rifles, like the latter ones mentioned are more common, 
                    and are usually found in better condition at a lower price.

            <section id="how">
                <h2>How I do it</h2>
                <p>
                    Mil-surp collecting is a daunting hobby at first, but once you 
                    get a basic understanding, it isn't that bad. I am a history 
                    buff, so I like looking around at how these older weapons were 
                    thought up, and how they work. Because of this, as well as 
                    being tought how to properly handle firearms by my parents when 
                    I was younger, I can better understand what I am looking at. I 
                    enjoy the collection I have, and when I want to get a new addition 
                    for it, I look at the sites I mentioned on the "Where I Look" 
                    page. Because of my age, I am able to own rifles, but because of 
                    age laws in my state, I cannot own pistols, so I ignore pistols 
                    and only collect rifles. Typically, I will look through the surplus 
                    rifles on a few different sites, looking for any that I might like 
                    to get. If I find one, I look in the description and at the pictures 
                    in the listing to get an idea of the rifle's quality. If the quality 
                    is good, I check the price, to see if it is a fair price for what I 
                    think it is valued. I get my idea for value based on the quality I get 
                    from the last step, and the price I can find the same or similar rifles 
                    going for on other online stores and auctions. If I think it is a 
                    good buy, then I will purchase it and ship it to an FFL near me. I 
                    then research how to break down the rifle for cleaning, and any 
                    other information about the rifle. After passing the background 
                    check and getting the rifle, I break it down and inspect the condition, 
                    and usually clean it and check if it is fireable. If it is, I order ammo, 
                    and if applicable, clips or mags(and yes there is a difference).

            <section id="why">
                <h2>Why do This?</h2>
                <p>
                    I like collecting military surplus firearms because I love 
                    learning about development and the history behind them. 
                    For example, I got an M1 Carbine because I wanted to learn more 
                    about the type of rifle my great grandfather used in the second 
                    world war. I also love the beauty of older firearms with the  
                    woodworking involved in them, whereas most modern firearms use 
                    lighter weight and more durable materials. Don't get me wrong, I 
                    love modern firearms as well, and I think the technological 
                    advancements made are incredible, but the history of mil-surps is 
                    what draws me to it.
