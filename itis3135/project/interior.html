                    Current Situation
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Currently, the van is bare, with the cargo wall between the 
                    cab and the cargo area removed. The cab is in good shape, and 
                    it will probably stay as is. Because it is a cargo van, it has 
                    no windows, and no temperature control or lighting in the back 
                    where the cargo area used to be. All of the interior in the cargo 
                    area has been emptied out, and is bare right now.

                <h3>
                    The Plan
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The cab will be kept the same for the most part, with the only 
                    modification being the addition of swivel systems to allow the 
                    cab seats to turn 180 degrees from the cab to the living area. 
                    For the basics, I will have insulated walls, ceiling, and floor, 
                    but haven't figured out the material I am using yet.
                    This is my first time doing something like a van conversion, and 
                    plan to use it mostly for recreation like camping, so I am planning 
                    to keep it pretty simple.

                        For plumbing, I plan to use a jug system for my fresh and 
                        greywater tanks, so they can be removed for filling and 
                        emptying. I want to have a full, single piece shower, but 
                        for the sink and toilet, I will use something easier, most 
                        likely a portable sink style, and a DIY 5 gallon bucket toilet.
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        For electrics, I want to have a solar system with an Eco flow 
                        power system, with the ability to add lithium ion batteries to 
                        it for a larger power bank. For lighting, I want to have LDE 
                        lighting put in at various points of the van.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For bedding, I plan to have a cot style bed, with hooks to 
                        use for hanging hammoks for additional bedding options. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For other plans, I am planning to add one or two airmax fans, 
                        along with double plane, hinge opening windows to open up and 
                        give the ability to see out of the van, as well as allow for 
                        plenty of air circulation through the van, while also keeping the 
                        van as insulated as possible. I will also plan to use a gym style 
                        interlocking floor.
