                Van Specs & exterior
            </h2>
            <p>
                Here, we will talk about the technical specifications of 
                the van, and what changes there will be on the exterior 
                of the van. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                The Van
            </h3>
            <p>
                The van is a 2010 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Cargo van with a 
                170" extended wheelbase and a High roof. This means that the 
                van came with no windows behind the cabin on the sides, and 
                a high roof means that the interior of the van is extended from 
                a height of 68.7 inches to a height of 79.1, giving an increase 
                of 10.4 inches in height for the interior of the van. The sprinter 
                lineup has a few different wheelbase lengths, being 144", 170", and 
                170" extended. This transfers to 19.4 feet, 22.8 feet, and 24.2 feet 
                wheelspan respectively. The van being converted is using the 170" 
                extended wheelbase, which is the biggest because the wheels are far 
                appart, like the 170" wheelbase, but also has more added to the back 
                of the van to extend the frame for the longest wheelbase available. 
                The desil engine, transmission, and suspension will be kept stock, 
                and there are additional features such as the back door full swivel 
                hinges.

            <h3>
                Plans
            </h3>
            <p>
                The diferential might need to be replaced down the line for safety, 
                but it is not needed to be replaced at the current time. We are 
                planning on attaching solar pannels to the roof, most likely using an 
                ecoflow power system. Ater installing a power system, and removing 
                the cargo wall, we plan on re-sealing the vehicle, removing surface 
                rust and scuff marks, and repaint part of, or all of the van.
