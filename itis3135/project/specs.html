                    The Van
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The van is a 2010 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Cargo van with a 
                    170" extended wheelbase and a High roof. This means that the 
                    van came with no windows behind the cabin on the sides, and 
                    a high roof means that the interior of the van is extended from 
                    a height of 68.7 inches to a height of 79.1, giving an increase 
                    of 10.4 inches in height for the interior of the van. The sprinter 
                    lineup has a few different wheelbase lengths, being 144", 170", and 
                    170" extended. This transfers to 19.4 feet, 22.8 feet, and 24.2 feet 
                    wheelspan respectively. The van being converted is using the 170" 
                    extended wheelbase, which is the biggest because the wheels are far 
                    appart, like the 170" wheelbase, but also has more added to the back 
                    of the van to extend the frame for the longest wheelbase available. 
                    The desil engine, transmission, and suspension will be kept stock, 
                    and there are additional features such as the back door full swivel 
                    hinges.

                    Plans
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The diferential might need to be replaced down the line for safety, 
                    but it is not needed to be replaced at the current time. I am 
                    planning on attaching solar pannels to the roof, most likely using an 
                    ecoflow power system. Ater installing that, along with other things 
                    like a fan and/or windows, along with removing the cargo wall, I 
                    plan to re-seal the vehicle, removing surface rust and scuff marks, 
                    and repaint part of, or all of the van. Another potenial addition would 
                    be a tire rack, or even a full toolkit on the back of the van.
