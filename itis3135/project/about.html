                About Me and my Van
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is D. I. von Briesen. I live in Charlotte NC, 
                and I am starting a van conversion. I first heard about van 
                conversions from a guy converting a van in my neighborhood, 
                and it peaked my interest. I asked him about it, and decided 
                to do some research on it myself. I followed my research into 
                buying a van to convert myself!
            </p>
