                Course Contract
            </h2>
            <p>I, Daniel W Teague agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2022, ITIS 3135, Web App Design and Developement with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.</p>
            
            <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
            
            <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
            
            <p>I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where i have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
