            <p>The home site for the different academic avenues on the UNCC page.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C: Words stand out from the page, and parts of the page stand out from one another</li>
                <li>R: Consistant design with the same font and colors used through the entire page</li>
                <li>A: A nice gid pattern keeps everything in line</li>
                <li>P: The page is very clearly organized by subject</li>

            <ul>
                <li>C: There is contrast, although overlap of the contrast counteracts/nullifies it to a degerr</li>
                <li>R: Everything is in boxes, but those boxes have no consistancy to them</li>
                <li>A: None whatsoever, everything is just thrown where ever</li>
                <li>P: None, things are thrown where they fit, not grouped together</li>
